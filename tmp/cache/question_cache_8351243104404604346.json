Structural Equivalence B. Assortative Mixing C. Regular Equivalence D. Network Density\n(e) Why might betweenness centrality be a more relevant measure than degree centrality for identifying critical nodes in a network transmitting information that must follow specific paths? [2]\nA. Because it measures the total number of connections a node has.\nB. Because it prioritizes nodes with high clustering coefficients.\nC. Because it is easier to calculate for large graphs.\nD. Because it quantifies how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes.\n(f) A key finding about scale-free networks (like those generated by the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model) is their robustness to random node failures but vulnerability to targeted attacks on hubs.

LTM uses edge probabilities independently; ICM uses a weighted sum of active neighbors compared to a node threshold.\nC. Both models rely solely on the number of active neighbors, ignoring edge weights or probabilities.\nD. ICM activates nodes based on global network properties, while LTM uses only local information.\n(j) A standard Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) aggregates information from a node's immediate neighbors. Why might this standard message-passing approach be suboptimal for tasks like node classification in networks with high heterophily (where connected nodes tend to be dissimilar)? [2]\nA. Because GCNs can only be applied to undirected graphs.\nB. Because aggregating features from dissimilar neighbors can blur the node's own representative features, making classification harder.\nC.

Because GCNs are computationally too expensive for heterophilic graphs.\n\nQuestion 2: A novel influenza strain (following an SIR - Susceptible, Infected, Recovered - model) is spreading in a city. You have access to a network graph representing close social contacts (nodes=people, edges=contacts).

Justify why your chosen concepts are appropriate and how they would be applied together.
